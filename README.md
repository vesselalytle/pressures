# pressures
CPO 2801 JS assignment "pressures"
/*Vessela Lytle/S#547557/COP2801
V = nRT/P, 
v is the volume in m3 
n is the number of kmols n = 1 kmol,
R = 8.3144 kPA-m3/kmol-K 
T is the temperature in kelvins T = 273.15,
P is the pressure in kPa  
pressure.js computes and prints V = nRT/P for a series of 
pressures using, using an array to hold, populated with 20 random pressure values between
 1 and 10,000 kPa.
